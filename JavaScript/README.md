## Team Preferences
So far as a team we have decided to use Microsoft Teams for the majority of our day to day communications as well as 
our scrum meetings. We have come to the conclusion that if we are not given time in class to meet then we will meet
that day at two thirty in the afternoon. We are fairly flexible on times that we can contact each other and are more
available in the evenings. Throughout this semester we hope to grow as developers as well as grow as a team.
Our goal is to have a product that we are proud of by the end of the semester. We believe that we can
accomplish this goal by starting early on tasks and assignments and not procrastinating. We have decided
that clear communication is key and that it is best for us to reach out to one another when stuck. It is
important to us that each team member does their fair share of work on assignments. Therefore, we will do our
best to evenly distribute work throughout the semester.

If our teammates are failing to get equal amounts of work done there are a few things we have decided would be
appropriate to do. Our first action would be to discuss as a team why a disproportionate amount of work is happening
and hopefully come to a solution together. If that fails the next thing to do would be to get a higher authority 
involved. This would be a last resort in the case of us as a group being unable to figure out why a person would
be unwilling to work with the group.  

Our team has decided to commit at least an hour a day each to work on code in addition to our scrums. We can modulate
the amount of work we do but roughly an hour a day should suffice. For delegating work, we will build on our individual 
strenghts so that if a teammate has expertise on a certain subject, they will more than likely be the one to do that task.
While we will come to joint decisions on larger topics, small things can be individually decided on as long as quality work
is submitted. If all but one teammate agrees on something, we will use a vote system to come to a consensus. We will have 
a different scrum master each sprint to ensure one teammate does not dominate the process of the team.
