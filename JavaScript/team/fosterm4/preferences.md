# Preferences for Michael Foster

1. __Is it generally easier to reach you by text, electronic mail, voice mail or something else?  What hours?__ 
   * I prefer Slack. Sometimes I am busy in the afternoons or mornings
   but for the most part I am available most of the day.
1. __What are your expectations about what your team will accomplish this semester?__ 
   * I would hope that we learn to work and develop as a team. I think developing communication skills
   as well as learning new technology is always a great thing. I'd like us to have
   a product that we are proud of at the end of the semester.
1. __What are your personal goals for improving your teamwork and communication skills this semester?__ 
   * I would like to get better at reachign out and setting up meetings when necessary. 
   I am also looking forward to learning more about working remote like we are to see
   if it would be a good fit for me in the future.
1. __What kinds of obstacles might you encounter in trying to reach both your team and personal goals?__ 
   * I know that school can always get busy especially for CS majors so I would say 
   that it will be important for us to all put effort into this project and to buckle 
   down when we need to get something done. I feel like procrastination can get the best of us
    in situations such as these.
1. __What happens if some people on the team want to get an “A” while others think a “B” will be acceptable?__ 
   * That is tough, I know in the syllabus it says if we go above and beyond
   individually then we may recieve better grades. I feel like this is just something we must
   work out and it is never a bad thing to strive to do the best you can.
1. __Is it acceptable for some team members to do more work on the assignment in order to get an “A”?__ 
   * I don't think so, I would say that it's best for us to all do our equal share of work.
   I don't think this is always realistic though and there is such a thing as trying too hard.
1. __How much time per week do you anticipate it will take to make the project successful?__ 
   * I believe Professor Matthews said 6-8 hours outside of class? I would guess this or more.
1. __How will you decide who should do what on the project and activities?__ 
   * If someone has previous experience in something or is specifically interested in something,
   I think it would be great to give that person that task.
1. __What will happen if someone doesn’t follow through on a commitment (missing deadline, no show, etc.)?__ 
   * I would say that the best initial course of action would be to have a team meeting with
   that person and talk about what happened. 
1. __What happens if people have different opinions on the quality of the work?__ 
   * A discussion always helps in a situation such as this and I think it comes down to whatever
   the majority of the team believes.
1. __How will you deal with different work habits of team members?__ 
   * I think it is important to get a feel for the work habits of team members and
   keep this in mind when working with them.
1. __Do you want to have a standing meeting time outside of class?__ 
   * I would say if we deem it necessary. Say if there is something else that we
   come across in standup that we feel like we need to talk more about that day then yes.
   But I don't think we need one set up all the time.
1. __How often do you think the team will need to meet outside of class?__ 
   * I would say fairly often but I think we can get a lot of communication done over
   slack as well.
1. __Will you need approval of every team member before making a decision?__ 
   * Big decisions yes, but on something like a small PR I don't think it's necessary.
1. __What will you do if every team member except one agrees on something?__ 
   * It's important to listen to that one team member and see if we can change our current 
   solution to better fit the vision of the whole team.
1. __What will you do if one person seems to be dominating the team process?__ 
   * Talking with that person during a team meeting about how you feel would go 
   a long way.
1. __What will you do if you feel most of the facilitation responsibilities are falling on you?__ 
   * Again, a team meeting on this should be able to clear something like this up
