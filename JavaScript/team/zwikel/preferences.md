# Preferences for Zachary Wikel

1. __Is it generally easier to reach you by text, electronic mail, voice mail or something else?  What hours?__ 
   * You can always reach me through slack or my phone number is 419-357-5143, either one works for me. I'm typically early to rise and early to bed so if you message me at midnight I probably won't respond right away.
1. __What are your expectations about what your team will accomplish this semester?__ 
   * I expect our team to do the best they can and put forth an honest effort. I don't expect things to be perfect nor do I expect everyone to be experts. We're all here to learn so let's work together and communicate to best of our abilities so we can create an outstanding product. By the end of this course I would like to confidently say what we all learned and improved on.
1. __What are your personal goals for improving your teamwork and communication skills this semester?__ 
   * I have previous teamwork and leadership experience but not from our field. I would like to be able to tailor my current skills more accurately for what this kind of job demands.
1. __What kinds of obstacles might you encounter in trying to reach both your team and personal goals?__ 
   * Doing everything remotely might be a challenge for a group of people who have never met before. That and the combination of being too busy/procrastination. If we all communicate and try our best though I think well be just fine.
1. __What happens if some people on the team want to get an “A” while others think a “B” will be acceptable?__ 
   * I don’t think there’s anything wrong with getting a B. I do think we should try our best though and not wait to the last minute. If we all come together as a team and do the work then an A is almost guaranteed.
1. __Is it acceptable for some team members to do more work on the assignment in order to get an “A”?__ 
   * I don’t think other members doing more work is the right answer. If there’s stuff that still needs to get done or be improved then ask the rest of the team for help. That being said, its hard to distribute work evenly so some people might do slightly more work unintentionally.
1. __How much time per week do you anticipate it will take to make the project successful?__ 
   * I'm not really sure right now but perhaps 6-8 hours a week. If we do things to standard to begin with I don't think it'll be much more than that.
1. __How will you decide who should do what on the project and activities?__ 
   * I'd like to see some initiative from my members when dividing the work up. If there's something interesting or something you would like to learn then go for it. However, I don't want each of us to focus on one specific aspect of the project. Rather, by the end of the course I would like for us to be all well rounded in the skills we learned.
1. __What will happen if someone doesn’t follow through on a commitment (missing deadline, no show, etc.)?__ 
   * I think as a team it would be better to handle first time and minor issues at our level. Really trying to communicate and see what we can do. Perhaps there was a miscommunication or just a simple mistake, things happen. However, if something becomes a bigger issue then we will push that up the instructors/TAs.
1. __What happens if people have different opinions on the quality of the work?__ 
   * Again, communication is key. We can talk about the quality of work deemed necessary for whatever were working on. Perfection is not something we can attain though.
1. __How will you deal with different work habits of team members?__ 
   * Deal makes it sound like the other work habits are bad or inconvenient. That’s all part of working as a team, were all different and work in different ways. We should be flexible and understanding as there’s not only one way to approach  a problem. 
1. __Do you want to have a standing meeting time outside of class?__ 
   * As of right now, it seems like we'll be meeting during class time. Hopefully this will be enough time but if there's things we still need to discuss then meeting outside of class is fine by me.
1. __How often do you think the team will need to meet outside of class?__ 
   * Once sounds enough to me but that could change.
1. __Will you need approval of every team member before making a decision?__ 
   * Every decision? No. Decisions that have an impact on the bigger picture? Yes. I would like to think that all big decisions will be made during meetings and the smaller stuff will be left to the individual team members. That being said, if someone does have a question about a decision they or someone else made please ask.
1. __What will you do if every team member except one agrees on something?__ 
   * It’s important to consider all options. We should revaluate whatever were deciding on and vote again. If that doesn’t resolve the issue, then well resort to the vote majority.
1. __What will you do if one person seems to be dominating the team process?__ 
   * I don’t think that’s necessarily bad as long as it’s in a professional manner. If they want to be the leader then go for it. However, they must also listen to the other team members and be able to pass the leadership role to anyone else who wants to try.
1. __What will you do if you feel most of the facilitation responsibilities are falling on you?__ 
   * I will facilitate a discussion where we will talk about my current feelings. From there we could distribute more of the responsibility and demands of the project across the team.
