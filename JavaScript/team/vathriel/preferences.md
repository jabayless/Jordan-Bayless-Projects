# Preferences for _Alex King_

1. __Is it generally easier to reach you by text, electronic mail, voice mail or something else?  What hours?__
   * In order of speed: 605-545-5381, Vathriel#0001 on discord, or alexking1997.ak@gmail.com
   * Slack will work fine too.
   * I'm generally awake from 8/9am to about midnight.
1. __What are your expectations about what your team will accomplish this semester?__
   * I expect that we should all learn a lot, and hopefully grow as team members in the interest of accomplishing our goals.
1. __What are your personal goals for improving your teamwork and communication skills this semester?__
   * I've always been introverted, so being able to make sure my perspective is heard, and getting help when I need it would be a big step.
1. __What kinds of obstacles might you encounter in trying to reach both your team and personal goals?__
   * This'll be my first time working as a team essentially remotely. I expect that could pose some difficulty in how efficient we are.
1. __What happens if some people on the team want to get an “A” while others think a “B” will be acceptable?__
   * We should all shoot for an A. While some teams may simply think it easier to delegate more work to the "tryhard" it is not only unfair but cheating ourselves. Working in a group provides us a great opportunity for help and we should embrace it to get as good of a grade as we can.
1. __Is it acceptable for some team members to do more work on the assignment in order to get an “A”?__
   * As per my previous answer, no. While it may be difficulty to always perfectly and evenly split work we should try as much as we can.
1. __How much time per week do you anticipate it will take to make the project successful?__
   * I am not sure. Based on the credit calculation of the class, I'd expect we'd all need to put in 6-9 hours of work a week. Which falls in line with what our professor said.
1. __How will you decide who should do what on the project and activities?__
   * It might be ideal to split work by who has strengths in that area. While all of us may not be superstars or may be at varying levels that can be an opportunity to grow in uncomfortable situations by reaching out and spending a bit extra time as well.
1. __What will happen if someone doesn’t follow through on a commitment (missing deadline, no show, etc.)?__
   * Optimistically we have a conversation about it and it doesn't happen again. If it continues to happen though we'd have to look for more impactful solutions. We should likely communicate this to the Professor as well. It is not our choice on how we are graded as he has said. So communication will be key there.
1. __What happens if people have different opinions on the quality of the work?__
   * We are working with incredibly powerful tools. Ideally we'd be able to come together as a team and discuss any refactors that may need to happen. Since we are a team being democratic about it is probably a good way forward.
1. __How will you deal with different work habits of team members?__
   * Having a team can be an incredible tool. Allowing us to check in on our teammates progress and holding our team members accountable. Motivating our team and helping where we fall short should be a goal.
1. __Do you want to have a standing meeting time outside of class?__
   * I would definitely be in favor of that. This is a rather big set of projects that will likely just get more complex with time. Having some time to talk about how we'll be integrating our code with each other would be great.
1. __How often do you think the team will need to meet outside of class?__
   * Once a week would be ideal. That way we can all discuss the direction we're going and talk about how exactly we want to be integrating various parts.
1. __Will you need approval of every team member before making a decision?__
   * I think this is a case where majority rules is probably best, but every member should be included in the process. In other words, don't do things behind others backs. Clearly that can be overstepped if we had to vote on things like function names. But overarching design choices are important for us all as our integrations will be dependent on each others work.
1. __What will you do if every team member except one agrees on something?__
   * The first step will be to try to see things from their perspective, and figure out the differences and compare and contrast that. It would likely have to come down to a vote on how we want it to work. So we must try to convince ourselves of the merit in their argument.
1. __What will you do if one person seems to be dominating the team process?__
   * Talking open and honestly at a meeting would likely be a benefit. We do not want to make the person feel attacked though. This is a time for us all to learn.
1. __What will you do if you feel most of the facilitation responsibilities are falling on you?__
   * I'll try to communicate what is going on to the best of my ability, and ask for help from the team.
