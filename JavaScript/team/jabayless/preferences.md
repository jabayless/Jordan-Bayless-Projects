1. __Is it generally easier to reach you by text, electronic mail, voice mail or something else?  What hours?__ 
   * I can be reached by text at 719-304-1192. Or on slack.
1. __What are your expectations about what your team will accomplish this semester?__ 
   * As a team I expect us to build our product for this class and all contribute equally. 
1. __What are your personal goals for improving your teamwork and communication skills this semester?__ 
   * My personal goal is to complete work very quickly and stay in constant communication with my teammates. 
1. __What kinds of obstacles might you encounter in trying to reach both your team and personal goals?__ 
   * Delegating work properly based on everyone's unique skill sets will be a challenge to overcome. 
1. __What happens if some people on the team want to get an “A” while others think a “B” will be acceptable?__ 
   * If everyone follows good coding procedures, we will all produce A level work. 
1. __Is it acceptable for some team members to do more work on the assignment in order to get an “A”?__ 
   * I don't think that is acceptable, obviously where some people have more knowledge, they will be able
	 to contribute more, however all work should be turned in at a high quality.  
1. __How much time per week do you anticipate it will take to make the project successful?__ 
   * In addition to attending lectures, studying, and meetings, I plan to put in an hour a day of actual coding. 
1. __What will happen if someone doesn’t follow through on a commitment (missing deadline, no show, etc.)?__ 
   * I think the team should first collaborate and handle it on a low level. If it is consistent, then get the professor involved.
1. __What happens if people have different opinions on the quality of the work?__ 
   * Constant communication should alleviate that issue. 
1. __How will you deal with different work habits of team members?__ 
   * As long as weekly we are all contributing the same level of work, we will be fine. 
1. __Do you want to have a standing meeting time outside of class?__ 
   *  I would like to meet outside of class if our work load gets to be large so we can all stay on top of it. 
1. __How often do you think the team will need to meet outside of class?__ 
   * At least once a week should be sufficient to meet outside of class. 
1. __Will you need approval of every team member before making a decision?__ 
   * I think people can manage their own work unless they get stuck and need help, then we should make a team decision. 
1. __What will you do if every team member except one agrees on something?__ 
   * Listen to their opinion and after hearing everyone use democracy to decide. 
1. __What will you do if one person seems to be dominating the team process?__ 
   * If we end up with a leader that is fine, as long as they are competent and hard working and respectful.
1. __What will you do if you feel most of the facilitation responsibilities are falling on you?__ 
   * Then I will step up to the plate and perform my best for the team's sake.
