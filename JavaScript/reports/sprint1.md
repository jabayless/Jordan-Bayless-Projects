## Planned Epics

*Introduction:*
Sprint 1 will be conducted from September 2nd through September 10th. During this period five epics are planned to be completed. These epics are: v1 protocol, team identification, about, where am I, and where is.  This comes to a total of 14 tasks and 25 story points for the duration of the sprint.  These epics are detailed below.

*Epic #1: v1 protocol:*
The purpose of this epic is to add server capabilities and make it viewable to users.
This is useful since the client can be connected to a variety of servers with different
features. In this epic the user must be able to click on the server information in the
footer to see information. There must also be an icon in the footer to show current 
connection as well as to signify more information is available.

*Epic #2: Team Identification:*
The purpose of this Epic is to choose a name in which to identify our team/project to the rest of the organization.
As such we have decided our team will be called *"Revenge of the Sprint".* The team name will be on both the client
and the server. It should appear in the header, footer, and browser instead of t##.

*Epic #3: About:*
This epic serves to provide the user with information about the team and its members. This includes a mission statement from the team summarizing the aim and values of the group. Following that, each team member will have a section containing information about themselves. This information should include name, image, and a short biography.

*Epic #4: Where am I?:*
The goal of this epic is to provide the user with their current location on the map upon startup of the application. 
After completion the user should also have the ability to return to their current location after changing their
view on the map. A distinct marker will distinguish the users current location from other locations.

*Epic #5: Where is?:*
The purpose of this epic is for the user to be able to see a location on the map using latitude and longitude.
A user will be able to type or paste a string containing the latitude and longitude into the app. 
Conversions will have to be made based on the input format.

## Review

#### Epics done  
1,2,3,4
#### Epics not done
Epic 5 was not done. 
#### What went well
Handled work efficiently and ahead of schedule. Equal contribution amongst team members. Better understanding of planning our work for the future. Superb communication amongst team members. Got everything done that we planned to do. 
#### Problems encountered and resolutions
Size of images on team bio was inconsistent requiring some changes in formatting. 

## Retrospective

#### What went well
How we accomplished all that we did was through high collaboration amongst ourselves and quick responses to team mates on slack. 
#### Potential improvements
Learning javascript more will help with more efficient development. Once our entire team is more familiar with the APIs used for the map, our development will go faster. 
#### What we will change next time
Next time, the tasks will be broken down initially across the epics into sub tasks to determine more specifically what work needs to be done.
