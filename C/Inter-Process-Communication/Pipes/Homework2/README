This folder contains four executables:
-Starter.c: which spawns the processes needed to test the values from a file that it opens
to see what type they are.
-Math.c: which checks if input from command line is a math type character.
-LowAlpha.c: which checks if input from command line is a letter A-M or a-m
-HighAlpha.c: which checks if input from command line is a letter N-Z or n-z

1.) The least significant 8 bits are returned from WEXITSTATUS() function
2.) #include<sys/wait.h>
3.) The return value from fork for the child process is 0.
4.) The fork call can fail if no processes can execute because memory is full.
5.) We are doing sequential processing.
